2. Select Lumen from character selection screen
3. Start playing!

## Tips
- **Multi-target**: Spread beams across multiple enemies for maximum DPS
- **Focus Fire**: All 3 beams on one tanky enemy for burst damage
- **Positioning**: Stay mobile to maintain line-of-sight with tethered enemies
- **Reload Management**: 3 ammo means you can quickly establish all beams then reload

## Balance Notes
- Total DPS: 3 DPS (with 3 active beams) + projectile damage
- Lower direct damage but strong sustained DPS
- Requires tactical target selection and positioning
- Medium reload speed provides balance between Pierce Sniper and Toxic Spray
